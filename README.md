ðŸŽ¯ Guess the Number (C++)
This is a simple C++ console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the game gives a hint â€” telling you if your guess is too high or too low â€” helping you move closer to the correct answer. The game continues until you guess the correct number, and then it shows how many attempts you took.

The program uses basic C++ features like cin and cout for input and output, if-else statements for logic, loops for repeated guessing, and rand() with srand() to generate a random number. It's a great beginner project to understand control structures, user interaction, and logic building in C++.

To run the game, you need a C++ compiler like g++. Compile the program using g++ guess_game.cpp -o guess_game, then run it using ./guess_game on Linux/macOS or guess_game.exe on Windows. The project contains just two files â€” the main source code file guess_game.cpp and this README.md file.

You can improve the game by adding features like a "Play Again" option, difficulty levels, a limit on the number of guesses, or a high score tracker. This project is a great starting point for learning programming through simple and fun logic.
